              One of the greatest challenges for any black mother is to raise her children safely to adulthood in America; and even then, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols, Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd make such a feat feel futile.  No parent should have to bury their child, and so many black mothers have. I love my children.  I invest in their emotional development and provide them with the best educational opportunities I can afford. Yet, America continues to trivialize their value as members of society because they are Black. Black people continue to be commodities to American culture, but not as human beings. I hope this book club is the beginning of dismantling that notion for the sake of my mental health and the lives of my children.  Please join in this dialogue.....this racial reckoning.....and this place of national healing.
