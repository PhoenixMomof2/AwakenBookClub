# AWAKEN Social Book Club App

# GibHub https://github.com/PhoenixMomof2/AwakenBookClub.git
# To clone: git@github.com:PhoenixMomof2/AwakenBookClub.git

# INTRODUCTION
The application has a React frontend styled with bootstrap.
The backend is a Ruby on Rails API.

This application has user authentication and authorization to control access to resources and CRUD features.

# About the application: 
I'm a mom.  I'm black.  I love to read.  But what I don't love is how racism is still so prevalent in America, so I wanted to create an app that gets some tough conversations going and gains more allies to the progressive movement.  Awaken is a collection of books I feel are a great starting point for various discussions about anti-racism, social-justice, and genuine equality in America.  While I know this is only the beginning of this application, I hope it grows and makes a positive social impact.  

## Backend Scripts
In the root project directory (AwakenBookClub), you can run:
### `bundle install` 
### `rails s` 
to get the back end going.

## Frontend Scripts
Open another terminal and in the project directory (front-end-awaken), you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start` 
to get the front end going.
